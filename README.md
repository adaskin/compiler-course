## **BIL 463 Compiler Design (Fall 2025)**

Lecture: 15:30am on Mondays @501

You are expected to have prior C programming experience and sufficient knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I will assume that you have taken at least the following CS departmental courses. 


* MAT107 Discrete Math, 
* BIL 121 C Programming, 
* BIL 201 Data Structure and Intro to Algorithms, 
* BIL206 Algorithm Design and Analysis 

This course is an undergraduate level introductory course on  the basic design principles of compilers and interpreters for general purpose programming languages. The topics include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, top down&bottom up parsers, code generation and optimization.   During the semester we will built a  mini  compiler for a modern language (such as Java) as parts of programming assignments. There will be also theoretical written assignments and exams based on math and algorithms. 


## **Textbooks and Course Material**

* No required textbook. 
* Lecture notes are based on 
* Introduction to Compilers and Language Design, Douglas Thain, 2nd edition, 2020.  Free online textbook:  [https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/](https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/) 
* [https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse401/22au/](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse401/22au/) 
* [https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/) 
* Dragon Book: Compilers: Principles, Techniques, & Tools, Aho, Lam, Sethi & Ullman, A-W.
* Engineering a Compiler, Cooper & Torczon.
* lecture notes are mainly copied from these resources!

## **Homework-coding assignments**

* Assigned via classroom.google.com  
* **3 or 4 programming projects**
  * You will  step by step  design&write a compiler for a programming language you will define and study its correctness efficiency etc.
    * You can use C or Python 
    * or a functional programming language Haskel or OCaml 
* 2 or 3 theoretical assignments
* Submissions through classroom.google.com & github.com
* No late submission
* Use of AI is permitted. You can use any AI tools for the assignments but you should acknowledge that in your assignment reports.

## **Grading**
There will be a 1 midterm and a 1 final exam. 

* 20% midterm (very similar to written assignments)
* 10% written assignments
* 30% programming projects
* 40% final exam (very similar to written assignments and some generic questions related to projects)

## **Discussion**
For the assignment submission/grading and discussions, we use classroom.google.com for this course.  In discussions and questions:

* Do not post solutions or any significant part of an assignment.
* Do not post anything not related to the course.
* Ask a question when you would like some help with something
* Post something when you would like to help others with something.

**Environment**
You should have Linux installed machine/virtual-machine.  Then install flex and bison. Or related tools for the language used.

- sudo apt-get update 
- sudo apt-get upgrade 
- sudo apt-get install flex bison

There is also Windows exes (google it) or you  can try

* linux-distros through Windows subsytem for Linux [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
    * remember to install build-essential package


## **Collaboration and Cheating Policy**

* Any kind of plagiarism and cheating are prohibited (Please, refer to the university cheating policy).
* If you benefit from some work of others, list them as references (online references or books) 
* Discussing the assignments or projects with your friends is allowed; but, all the submitted work should be yours alone. List your collaborators (if you discuss your homework with your friends) in your assignments.
